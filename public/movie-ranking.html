<h1>Best movies ever!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>1. How to train your dragon</h3>
<p>This has been a huge part of my childhood and the story and the music and the setting and everything is just top tier and I could never get enough hehe</p>

<h3>2. Shutter Island</h3>
<p>At first I thoguth that I wouldn't love the movie but it just kept getting better and better and the plot twist at the end is just ughhhhh</p>

<h3>3. The shawshank redemption</h3>
<p>As usual one of the greatest movies of all time in general and it's just perfect. The actors also played a huge part in how good this movie turned out to be</p>
